# Three-dimensional-Snake-Based-on-Gesture-
We Use Gesture recognition module Paj7620 and Xilinx PYNQ z2 to visualize the 3D 'Snake' Game

The ZIP file consists of 3 main verilog file of the vivado project due to the size of project files;

# PYNQ Core #
We use PYNQ tp control the 3D Cube (8*8*8 RGB cubeï¼Œusing ws2812),and furthermore create a 'Snake' module which consists of all the regular rules '3D Snake' has;

# Gesture Recognitio n#
We Use Paj7620 as our gesture recognition module to identify 6 gestures 
including'up,down,left,right,forward and backward' to control the move of the Snake
