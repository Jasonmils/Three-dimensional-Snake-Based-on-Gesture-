# Three-dimensional-Snake-Based-on-Gesture-
We Use Gesture recognition module Paj7620 and Xilinx PYNQ z2 to visualize the 3D 'Snake' Game

The ZIP file consists of 3 main verilog file of the vivado project due to the size of project files;

#PYNQ Core #
We use PYNQ tp control the 3D Cube (8*8*8 RGB cube),and furthermore create a 'Snake' module which consists of all the rules 'Snake' has;

#Gesture Recognition#
We Use Paj7620 as our gesture recognition module to identify 6 gestures 
including'up,down,left,right,forward and backward'
